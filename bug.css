The following CSS rule unintentionally targets more elements than expected due to the lack of specificity:

```css
.container p { color: blue; }
```

If another element, say a `<div>` inside `.container` also contains a `<p>` element it will be affected.

For example:

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>This paragraph will be blue.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph will *also* be blue, unexpectedly.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
