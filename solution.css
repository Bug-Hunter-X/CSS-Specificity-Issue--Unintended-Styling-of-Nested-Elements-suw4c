To fix this, use a more specific selector to target only the intended `<p>` elements.  For instance:

```css
.container > p { color: blue; }
```

The `>` child selector ensures that only direct children `<p>` of `.container` are affected.  Alternatively, for more complex scenarios, consider using more specific selectors or class names for finer-grained control.

Another solution:

```css
.container p.main-paragraph { color: blue; }
```

Adding a class `main-paragraph` to the intended paragraph elements provides another level of specificity.
